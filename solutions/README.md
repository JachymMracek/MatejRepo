# Directory for your solutions
Please use this directory for all your solutions.

Separate directory for each task you will be working on
is highly recommended - a new directory, a new `.sln` and
a new `.csproj` file for each task. Example:
```
/solutions/01-AllTheColors/
/solutions/01-AllTheColors/01-AllTheColors.sln
/solutions/01-AllTheColors/01-AllTheColors.csproj
```
By the way, this is the easiest way to create a new project + solution
in `Visual Studio`.

# Rewrite this README.md file
Please overwrite this `README.md` file with your own documentation.

Every task should have its own documentation, use default file-names
`README.md` as well.
